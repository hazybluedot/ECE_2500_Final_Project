Ever wonder what the color code of the resisotor you are looking for
is? Well, this project allows the user to enter in a resistor value
and it will output the color band for you to look for.

<!-- more -->

To make run `make`
Then run `./res [value...]`

where `value` is a valid resistor value. If no values are given on the
command line the program will read lines from standard input.

The file `test/lowpass.bom` is an example bill of materials file
generated by `gnetlist`.

$ grep 'RESISTOR' test/lowpass.bom | cut -f 3 | ./res
